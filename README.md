# Python-Keylogger
A keylogger is a program that records the keystrokes made on a computer keyboard. In Python, it is possible to create a keylogger by using the pynput module, which allows you to control and monitor the keyboard and mouse.

This code will write the keystrokes on to the today's data file. You can modify this code to save the recorded keystrokes to a send them to a remote server. 

However, please note that creating and using a keylogger can be illegal and unethical, so be sure to use it responsibly and only with the proper consent of the user.
